// MARK: - DrawingArea Class

/// The `GtkDrawingArea` widget is used for creating custom user interface
/// elements. It’s essentially a blank widget; you can draw on it. After
/// creating a drawing area, the application may want to connect to:
/// 
/// - Mouse and button press signals to respond to input from
///   the user. (Use `gtk_widget_add_events()` to enable events
///   you wish to receive.)
/// 
/// - The `GtkWidget::realize` signal to take any necessary actions
///   when the widget is instantiated on a particular display.
///   (Create GDK resources in response to this signal.)
/// 
/// - The `GtkWidget::size-allocate` signal to take any necessary
///   actions when the widget changes size.
/// 
/// - The `GtkWidget::draw` signal to handle redrawing the
///   contents of the widget.
/// 
/// The following code portion demonstrates using a drawing
/// area to display a circle in the normal widget foreground
/// color.
/// 
/// Note that GDK automatically clears the exposed area before sending
/// the expose event, and that drawing is implicitly clipped to the exposed
/// area. If you want to have a theme-provided background, you need
/// to call `gtk_render_background()` in your `draw` method.
/// 
/// ## Simple GtkDrawingArea usage

/// of the widget, the widget will scroll so that the cursor
/// position is visible.
/// 
/// When using an entry for passwords and other sensitive information,
/// it can be put into “password mode” using `gtk_entry_set_visibility()`.
/// In this mode, entered text is displayed using a “invisible” character.
/// By default, GTK+ picks the best invisible character that is available
/// in the current font, but it can be changed with
/// `gtk_entry_set_invisible_char()`. Since 2.16, GTK+ displays a warning
/// when Caps Lock or input methods might interfere with entering text in
/// a password entry. The warning can be turned off with the
/// `GtkEntry:caps-lock-warning` property.
/// 
/// Since 2.16, GtkEntry has the ability to display progress or activity
/// information behind the text. To make an entry display such information,
/// use `gtk_entry_set_progress_fraction()` or `gtk_entry_set_progress_pulse_step()`.
/// 
/// Additionally, GtkEntry can show icons at either side of the entry. These
/// icons can be activatable by clicking, can be set up as drag source and
/// can have tooltips. To add an icon, use `gtk_entry_set_icon_from_gicon()` or
/// one of the various other functions that set an icon from a stock id, an
/// icon name or a pixbuf. To trigger an action when the user clicks an icon,
/// connect to the `GtkEntry::icon-press` signal. To allow DND operations
/// from an icon, use `gtk_entry_set_icon_drag_source()`. To set a tooltip on
/// an icon, use `gtk_entry_set_icon_tooltip_text()` or the corresponding function
/// for markup.
/// 
/// Note that functionality or information that is only available by clicking
/// on an icon in an entry may not be accessible at all to users which are not
/// able to use a mouse or other pointing device. It is therefore recommended
/// that any such functionality should also be available by other means, e.g.
/// via the context menu of the entry.

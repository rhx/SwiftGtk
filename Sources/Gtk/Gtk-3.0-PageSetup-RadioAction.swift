// MARK: - PopoverMenu Class

/// GtkPopoverMenu is a subclass of `GtkPopover` that treats its
/// children like menus and allows switching between them. It is
/// meant to be used primarily together with `GtkModelButton`, but
/// any widget can be used, such as `GtkSpinButton` or `GtkScale`.
/// In this respect, GtkPopoverMenu is more flexible than popovers
/// that are created from a `GMenuModel` with `gtk_popover_new_from_model()`.
/// 
/// To add a child as a submenu, set the `GtkPopoverMenu:submenu`
/// child property to the name of the submenu. To let the user open
/// this submenu, add a `GtkModelButton` whose `GtkModelButton:menu-name`
/// property is set to the name you've given to the submenu.
/// 
/// By convention, the first child of a submenu should be a `GtkModelButton`
/// to switch back to the parent menu. Such a button should use the
/// `GtkModelButton:inverted` and `GtkModelButton:centered` properties
/// to achieve a title-like appearance and place the submenu indicator
/// at the opposite side. To switch back to the main menu, use "main"
/// as the menu name.

// MARK: - CellLayout Interface

/// An interface for packing cells
/// 
/// `GtkCellLayout` is an interface to be implemented by all objects which
/// want to provide a `GtkTreeViewColumn` like API for packing cells,
/// setting attributes and data funcs.
/// 
/// One of the notable features provided by implementations of
/// `GtkCellLayout` are attributes. Attributes let you set the properties
/// in flexible ways. They can just be set to constant values like regular
/// properties. But they can also be mapped to a column of the underlying
/// tree model with `gtk_cell_layout_set_attributes()`, which means that the value
/// of the attribute can change from cell to cell as they are rendered by
/// the cell renderer. Finally, it is possible to specify a function with
/// `gtk_cell_layout_set_cell_data_func()` that is called to determine the
/// value of the attribute for each cell that is rendered.
/// 
/// # GtkCellLayouts as GtkBuildable
/// 
/// Implementations of GtkCellLayout which also implement the GtkBuildable
/// interface (`GtkCellView`, `GtkIconView`, `GtkComboBox`,
/// `GtkEntryCompletion`, `GtkTreeViewColumn`) accept `GtkCellRenderer` objects
/// as &lt;child&gt; elements in UI definitions. They support a custom &lt;attributes&gt;
/// element for their children, which can contain multiple &lt;attribute&gt;
/// elements. Each &lt;attribute&gt; element has a name attribute which specifies
/// a property of the cell renderer; the content of the element is the
/// attribute value.
/// 
/// This is an example of a UI definition fragment specifying attributes:
/// ```
/// <object class="GtkCellView">
///   <child>
///     <object class="GtkCellRendererText"/>
///     <attributes>
///       <attribute name="text">0</attribute>
///     </attributes>
///   </child>"
/// </object>
/// ```
/// 
/// Furthermore for implementations of GtkCellLayout that use a `GtkCellArea`
/// to lay out cells (all GtkCellLayouts in GTK use a GtkCellArea)
/// [cell properties](#cell-properties) can also be defined in the format by
/// specifying the custom &lt;cell-packing&gt; attribute which can contain multiple
/// &lt;property&gt; elements defined in the normal way.
/// 
/// Here is a UI definition fragment specifying cell properties:
///

/// # Subclassing GtkCellLayout implementations
/// 
/// When subclassing a widget that implements `GtkCellLayout` like

/// (C Language Example):
/// ```C
/// combo = g_object_new (GTK_TYPE_COMBO_BOX, "cell-area", my_cell_area, NULL);
/// ```
/// 
/// to use a custom cell area with a combo box. But construct properties
/// are only initialized after instance `init()`
/// functions have run, which means that using functions which rely on
/// the existence of the cell area in your subclass’ `init()` function will
/// cause the default cell area to be instantiated. In this case, a provided
/// construct property value will be ignored (with a warning, to alert
/// you to the problem).
/// 
/// (C Language Example):
/// ```C
/// static void
/// my_combo_box_init (MyComboBox *b)
/// {
///   GtkCellRenderer *cell;
/// 
///   cell = gtk_cell_renderer_pixbuf_new ();

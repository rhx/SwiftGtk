/// GtkOverlay is a container which contains a single main child, on top
/// of which it can place “overlay” widgets. The position of each overlay
/// widget is determined by its `GtkWidget:halign` and `GtkWidget:valign`
/// properties. E.g. a widget with both alignments set to `GTK_ALIGN_START`
/// will be placed at the top left corner of the GtkOverlay container,
/// whereas an overlay with halign set to `GTK_ALIGN_CENTER` and valign set
/// to `GTK_ALIGN_END` will be placed a the bottom edge of the GtkOverlay,
/// horizontally centered. The position can be adjusted by setting the margin
/// properties of the child to non-zero values.
/// 
/// More complicated placement of overlays is possible by connecting
/// to the `GtkOverlay::get-child-position` signal.
/// 
/// An overlay’s minimum and natural sizes are those of its main child. The sizes
/// of overlay children are not considered when measuring these preferred sizes.

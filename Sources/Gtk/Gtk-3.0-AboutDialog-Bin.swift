// MARK: - AboutDialog Class

/// The GtkAboutDialog offers a simple way to display information about
/// a program like its logo, name, copyright, website and license. It is
/// also possible to give credits to the authors, documenters, translators
/// and artists who have worked on the program. An about dialog is typically
/// opened when the user selects the `About` option from the `Help` menu.
/// All parts of the dialog are optional.
/// 
/// About dialogs often contain links and email addresses. GtkAboutDialog
/// displays these as clickable links. By default, it calls `gtk_show_uri_on_window()`
/// when a user clicks one. The behaviour can be overridden with the
/// `GtkAboutDialog::activate-link` signal.
/// 
/// To specify a person with an email address, use a string like
/// "Edgar Allan Poe &lt;edgar\`poe.com`&gt;". To specify a website with a title,
/// use a string like "GTK+ team http://www.gtk.org".
/// 
/// To make constructing a GtkAboutDialog as convenient as possible, you can
/// use the function `gtk_show_about_dialog()` which constructs and shows a dialog
/// and keeps it around so that it can be shown again.
/// 
/// Note that GTK+ sets a default title of ``_("About %s")`` on the dialog
/// window (where \`s` is replaced by the name of the application, but in
/// order to ensure proper translation of the title, applications should
/// set the title property explicitly when constructing a GtkAboutDialog,
/// as shown in the following example:
/// (C Language Example):
/// ```C
/// GdkPixbuf *example_logo = gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file ("./logo.png", NULL);
/// gtk_show_about_dialog (NULL,
///                        "program-name", "ExampleCode",
///                        "logo", example_logo,
///                        "title", _("About ExampleCode"),
///                        NULL);
/// ```
/// 
/// It is also possible to show a `GtkAboutDialog` like any other `GtkDialog`,
/// e.g. using `gtk_dialog_run()`. In this case, you might need to know that
/// the “Close” button returns the `GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL` response id.
///
/// The `AboutDialogProtocol` protocol exposes the methods and properties of an underlying `GtkAboutDialog` instance.
/// The default implementation of these can be found in the protocol extension below.
/// For a concrete class that implements these methods and properties, see `AboutDialog`.
/// Alternatively, use `AboutDialogRef` as a lighweight, `unowned` reference if you already have an instance you just want to use.

/// The `GtkAccelLabel` widget is a subclass of `GtkLabel` that also displays an
/// accelerator key on the right of the label text, e.g. “Ctrl+S”.
/// It is commonly used in menus to show the keyboard short-cuts for commands.
/// 
/// The accelerator key to display is typically not set explicitly (although it
/// can be, with `gtk_accel_label_set_accel()`). Instead, the `GtkAccelLabel` displays
/// the accelerators which have been added to a particular widget. This widget is
/// set by calling `gtk_accel_label_set_accel_widget()`.
/// 
/// For example, a `GtkMenuItem` widget may have an accelerator added to emit
/// the “activate” signal when the “Ctrl+S” key combination is pressed.
/// A `GtkAccelLabel` is created and added to the `GtkMenuItem`, and
/// `gtk_accel_label_set_accel_widget()` is called with the `GtkMenuItem` as the
/// second argument. The `GtkAccelLabel` will now display “Ctrl+S” after its label.
/// 
/// Note that creating a `GtkMenuItem` with `gtk_menu_item_new_with_label()` (or
/// one of the similar functions for `GtkCheckMenuItem` and `GtkRadioMenuItem`)
/// automatically adds a `GtkAccelLabel` to the `GtkMenuItem` and calls
/// `gtk_accel_label_set_accel_widget()` to set it up for you.
/// 
/// A `GtkAccelLabel` will only display accelerators which have `GTK_ACCEL_VISIBLE`
/// set (see `GtkAccelFlags`).
/// A `GtkAccelLabel` can display multiple accelerators and even signal names,
/// though it is almost always used to display just one accelerator key.

/// Currently, GtkApplication handles GTK+ initialization, application

// MARK: - ApplicationWindow Class

/// `GtkApplicationWindow` is a `GtkWindow` subclass that offers some
/// extra functionality for better integration with `GtkApplication`
/// features.  Notably, it can handle both the application menu as well
/// as the menubar. See `gtk_application_set_app_menu()` and
/// `gtk_application_set_menubar()`.
/// 
/// This class implements the `GActionGroup` and `GActionMap` interfaces,
/// to let you add window-specific actions that will be exported by the
/// associated `GtkApplication`, together with its application-wide
/// actions.  Window-specific actions are prefixed with the “win.”
/// prefix and application-wide actions are prefixed with the “app.”
/// prefix.  Actions must be addressed with the prefixed name when
/// referring to them from a `GMenuModel`.
/// 
/// Note that widgets that are placed inside a `GtkApplicationWindow`
/// can also activate these actions, if they implement the
/// `GtkActionable` interface.
/// 
/// As with `GtkApplication`, the GDK lock will be acquired when
/// processing actions arriving from other processes and should therefore
/// be held when activating actions locally (if GDK threads are enabled).
/// 
/// The settings `GtkSettings:gtk-shell-shows-app-menu` and
/// `GtkSettings:gtk-shell-shows-menubar` tell GTK+ whether the
/// desktop environment is showing the application menu and menubar
/// models outside the application as part of the desktop shell.
/// For instance, on OS X, both menus will be displayed remotely;
/// on Windows neither will be. gnome-shell (starting with version 3.4)
/// will display the application menu, but not the menubar.
/// 
/// If the desktop environment does not display the menubar, then
/// `GtkApplicationWindow` will automatically show a `GtkMenuBar` for it.
/// This behaviour can be overridden with the `GtkApplicationWindow:show-menubar`
/// property. If the desktop environment does not display the application
/// menu, then it will automatically be included in the menubar or in the
/// windows client-side decorations.
/// 
/// ## A GtkApplicationWindow with a menubar
/// 
/// (C Language Example):
/// ```C
/// GtkApplication *app = gtk_application_new ("org.gtk.test", 0);
/// 
/// GtkBuilder *builder = gtk_builder_new_from_string (
///     "<interface>"
///     "  <menu id='menubar'>"

///     "    </submenu>"
///     "  </menu>"
///     "</interface>",

///                                                             "menubar"));

/// // ...

/// GtkWidget *window = gtk_application_window_new (app);
/// ```
/// 
/// ## Handling fallback yourself
/// 
/// [A simple example](https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/tree/examples/sunny.c)
/// 
/// The XML format understood by `GtkBuilder` for `GMenuModel` consists
/// of a toplevel `&lt;menu&gt;` element, which contains one or more `&lt;item&gt;`
/// elements. Each `&lt;item&gt;` element contains `&lt;attribute&gt;` and `&lt;link&gt;`
/// elements with a mandatory name attribute. `&lt;link&gt;` elements have the
/// same content model as `&lt;menu&gt;`. Instead of `&lt;link name="submenu&gt;` or
/// `&lt;link name="section"&gt;`, you can use `&lt;submenu&gt;` or `&lt;section&gt;`
/// elements.
/// 
/// Attribute values can be translated using gettext, like other `GtkBuilder`
/// content. `&lt;attribute&gt;` elements can be marked for translation with a
/// `translatable="yes"` attribute. It is also possible to specify message
/// context and translator comments, using the context and comments attributes.
/// To make use of this, the `GtkBuilder` must have been given the gettext
/// domain to use.
/// 
/// The following attributes are used when constructing menu items:
/// - "label": a user-visible string to display
/// - "action": the prefixed name of the action to trigger
/// - "target": the parameter to use when activating the action
/// - "icon" and "verb-icon": names of icons that may be displayed
/// - "submenu-action": name of an action that may be used to determine
///      if a submenu can be opened
/// - "hidden-when": a string used to determine when the item will be hidden.
///      Possible values include "action-disabled", "action-missing", "macos-menubar".
/// 
/// The following attributes are used when constructing sections:
/// - "label": a user-visible string to use as section heading
/// - "display-hint": a string used to determine special formatting for the section.
///     Possible values include "horizontal-buttons".
/// - "text-direction": a string used to determine the `GtkTextDirection` to use
///     when "display-hint" is set to "horizontal-buttons". Possible values
///     include "rtl", "ltr", and "none".
/// 
/// The following attributes are used when constructing submenus:

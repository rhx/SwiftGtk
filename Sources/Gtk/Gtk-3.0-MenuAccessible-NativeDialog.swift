/// 
/// Model buttons are used when popovers from a menu model with
/// `gtk_popover_new_from_model()`; they can also be used manually in
/// a `GtkPopoverMenu`.
/// 
/// When the action is specified via the `GtkActionable:action-name`
/// and `GtkActionable:action-target` properties, the role of the button
/// (i.e. whether it is a plain, check or radio button) is determined by
/// the type of the action and doesn't have to be explicitly specified
/// with the `GtkModelButton:role` property.
/// 
/// The content of the button is specified by the `GtkModelButton:text`
/// and `GtkModelButton:icon` properties.
/// 
/// The appearance of model buttons can be influenced with the
/// `GtkModelButton:centered` and `GtkModelButton:iconic` properties.
/// 
/// Model buttons have built-in support for submenus in `GtkPopoverMenu`.
/// To make a GtkModelButton that opens a submenu when activated, set

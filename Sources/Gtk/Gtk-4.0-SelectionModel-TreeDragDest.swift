// MARK: - SelectionModel Interface

/// `GtkSelectionModel` is an interface that add support for selection to list models.
/// 
/// This support is then used by widgets using list models to add the ability
/// to select and unselect various items.
/// 
/// GTK provides default implementations of the most common selection modes such
/// as [class`Gtk.SingleSelection`], so you will only need to implement this
/// interface if you want detailed control about how selections should be handled.
/// 
/// A `GtkSelectionModel` supports a single boolean per item indicating if an item is
/// selected or not. This can be queried via [method`Gtk.SelectionModel.is_selected`].
/// When the selected state of one or more items changes, the model will emit the
/// [signal`Gtk.SelectionModel::selection-changed`] signal by calling the
/// [method`Gtk.SelectionModel.selection_changed`] function. The positions given
/// in that signal may have their selection state changed, though that is not a
/// requirement. If new items added to the model via the `items-changed` signal
/// are selected or not is up to the implementation.
/// 
/// Note that items added via `items-changed` may already be selected and no
/// [Gtk.SelectionModel`selection-changed`] will be emitted for them. So to
/// track which items are selected, it is necessary to listen to both signals.
/// 
/// Additionally, the interface can expose functionality to select and unselect
/// items. If these functions are implemented, GTK's list widgets will allow users
/// to select and unselect items. However, `GtkSelectionModel`s are free to only
/// implement them partially or not at all. In that case the widgets will not
/// support the unimplemented operations.
/// 
/// When selecting or unselecting is supported by a model, the return values of
/// the selection functions do *not* indicate if selection or unselection happened.
/// They are only meant to indicate complete failure, like when this mode of
/// selecting is not supported by the model.
/// 
/// Selections may happen asynchronously, so the only reliable way to find out
/// when an item was selected is to listen to the signals that indicate selection.
///
/// The `SelectionModelProtocol` protocol exposes the methods and properties of an underlying `GtkSelectionModel` instance.
/// The default implementation of these can be found in the protocol extension below.
/// For a concrete class that implements these methods and properties, see `SelectionModel`.

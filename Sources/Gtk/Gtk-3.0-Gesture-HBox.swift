// MARK: - Gesture Class

/// `GtkGesture` is the base object for gesture recognition, although this
/// object is quite generalized to serve as a base for multi-touch gestures,
/// it is suitable to implement single-touch and pointer-based gestures (using
/// the special `nil` `GdkEventSequence` value for these).
/// 
/// The number of touches that a `GtkGesture` need to be recognized is controlled
/// by the `GtkGesture:n-points` property, if a gesture is keeping track of less
/// or more than that number of sequences, it won't check wether the gesture
/// is recognized.
/// 
/// As soon as the gesture has the expected number of touches, the gesture will
/// run the `GtkGesture::check` signal regularly on input events until the gesture
/// is recognized, the criteria to consider a gesture as "recognized" is left to
/// `GtkGesture` subclasses.
/// 
/// A recognized gesture will then emit the following signals:
/// - `GtkGesture::begin` when the gesture is recognized.
/// - A number of `GtkGesture::update`, whenever an input event is processed.
/// - `GtkGesture::end` when the gesture is no longer recognized.
/// 
/// ## Event propagation
/// 
/// In order to receive events, a gesture needs to either set a propagation phase
/// through `gtk_event_controller_set_propagation_phase()`, or feed those manually
/// through `gtk_event_controller_handle_event()`.
/// 
/// In the capture phase, events are propagated from the toplevel down to the
/// target widget, and gestures that are attached to containers above the widget
/// get a chance to interact with the event before it reaches the target.
/// 
/// After the capture phase, GTK+ emits the traditional `GtkWidget::button-press-event`,
/// `GtkWidget::button-release-event`, `GtkWidget::touch-event`, etc signals. Gestures
/// with the `GTK_PHASE_TARGET` phase are fed events from the default `GtkWidget::event`
/// handlers.
/// 
/// In the bubble phase, events are propagated up from the target widget to the
/// toplevel, and gestures that are attached to containers above the widget get
/// a chance to interact with events that have not been handled yet.
/// 
/// ## States of a sequence # <a name="touch-sequence-states"></a>
/// 
/// Whenever input interaction happens, a single event may trigger a cascade of
/// `GtkGestures`, both across the parents of the widget receiving the event and
/// in parallel within an individual widget. It is a responsibility of the
/// widgets using those gestures to set the state of touch sequences accordingly
/// in order to enable cooperation of gestures around the `GdkEventSequences`
/// triggering those.
/// 
/// Within a widget, gestures can be grouped through `gtk_gesture_group()`,
/// grouped gestures synchronize the state of sequences, so calling
/// `gtk_gesture_set_sequence_state()` on one will effectively propagate
/// the state throughout the group.
/// 
/// By default, all sequences start out in the `GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_NONE` state,
/// sequences in this state trigger the gesture event handler, but event
/// propagation will continue unstopped by gestures.
/// 
/// If a sequence enters into the `GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_DENIED` state, the gesture
/// group will effectively ignore the sequence, letting events go unstopped
/// through the gesture, but the "slot" will still remain occupied while
/// the touch is active.
/// 
/// If a sequence enters in the `GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_CLAIMED` state, the gesture
/// group will grab all interaction on the sequence, by:
/// - Setting the same sequence to `GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_DENIED` on every other gesture
///   group within the widget, and every gesture on parent widgets in the propagation
///   chain.
/// - calling `GtkGesture::cancel` on every gesture in widgets underneath in the
///   propagation chain.
/// - Stopping event propagation after the gesture group handles the event.
/// 
/// Note: if a sequence is set early to `GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_CLAIMED` on
/// `GDK_TOUCH_BEGIN`/`GDK_BUTTON_PRESS` (so those events are captured before
/// reaching the event widget, this implies `GTK_PHASE_CAPTURE`), one similar
/// event will emulated if the sequence changes to `GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_DENIED`.
/// This way event coherence is preserved before event propagation is unstopped
/// again.
/// 
/// Sequence states can't be changed freely, see `gtk_gesture_set_sequence_state()`
/// to know about the possible lifetimes of a `GdkEventSequence`.
/// 
/// ## Touchpad gestures
/// 
/// On the platforms that support it, `GtkGesture` will handle transparently
/// touchpad gesture events. The only precautions users of `GtkGesture` should do
/// to enable this support are:
/// - Enabling `GDK_TOUCHPAD_GESTURE_MASK` on their `GdkWindows`
/// - If the gesture has `GTK_PHASE_NONE`, ensuring events of type
///   `GDK_TOUCHPAD_SWIPE` and `GDK_TOUCHPAD_PINCH` are handled by the `GtkGesture`
///
/// The `GestureProtocol` protocol exposes the methods and properties of an underlying `GtkGesture` instance.
/// The default implementation of these can be found in the protocol extension below.
/// For a concrete class that implements these methods and properties, see `Gesture`.
/// Alternatively, use `GestureRef` as a lighweight, `unowned` reference if you already have an instance you just want to use.

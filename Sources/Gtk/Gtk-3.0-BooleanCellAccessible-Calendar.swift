// MARK: - Builder Class

/// A GtkBuilder is an auxiliary object that reads textual descriptions
/// of a user interface and instantiates the described objects. To create
/// a GtkBuilder from a user interface description, call
/// `gtk_builder_new_from_file()`, `gtk_builder_new_from_resource()` or
/// `gtk_builder_new_from_string()`.
/// 
/// In the (unusual) case that you want to add user interface
/// descriptions from multiple sources to the same GtkBuilder you can
/// call `gtk_builder_new()` to get an empty builder and populate it by
/// (multiple) calls to `gtk_builder_add_from_file()`,
/// `gtk_builder_add_from_resource()` or `gtk_builder_add_from_string()`.
/// 
/// A GtkBuilder holds a reference to all objects that it has constructed
/// and drops these references when it is finalized. This finalization can
/// cause the destruction of non-widget objects or widgets which are not
/// contained in a toplevel window. For toplevel windows constructed by a
/// builder, it is the responsibility of the user to call `gtk_widget_destroy()`
/// to get rid of them and all the widgets they contain.
/// 
/// The functions `gtk_builder_get_object()` and `gtk_builder_get_objects()`
/// can be used to access the widgets in the interface by the names assigned
/// to them inside the UI description. Toplevel windows returned by these
/// functions will stay around until the user explicitly destroys them
/// with `gtk_widget_destroy()`. Other widgets will either be part of a
/// larger hierarchy constructed by the builder (in which case you should
/// not have to worry about their lifecycle), or without a parent, in which
/// case they have to be added to some container to make use of them.
/// Non-widget objects need to be reffed with `g_object_ref()` to keep them
/// beyond the lifespan of the builder.
/// 
/// The function `gtk_builder_connect_signals()` and variants thereof can be
/// used to connect handlers to the named signals in the description.
/// 
/// # GtkBuilder UI Definitions # <a name="BUILDER-UI"></a>
/// 
/// GtkBuilder parses textual descriptions of user interfaces which are
/// specified in an XML format which can be roughly described by the
/// RELAX NG schema below. We refer to these descriptions as “GtkBuilder
/// UI definitions” or just “UI definitions” if the context is clear.
/// Do not confuse GtkBuilder UI Definitions with
/// [GtkUIManager UI Definitions](#XML-UI), which are more limited in scope.
/// It is common to use `.ui` as the filename extension for files containing
/// GtkBuilder UI definitions.
/// 
/// [RELAX NG Compact Syntax](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/blob/gtk-3-24/gtk/gtkbuilder.rnc)
/// 
/// The toplevel element is &lt;interface&gt;. It optionally takes a “domain”
/// attribute, which will make the builder look for translated strings
/// using `dgettext()` in the domain specified. This can also be done by
/// calling `gtk_builder_set_translation_domain()` on the builder.
/// Objects are described by &lt;object&gt; elements, which can contain
/// &lt;property&gt; elements to set properties, &lt;signal&gt; elements which
/// connect signals to handlers, and &lt;child&gt; elements, which describe
/// child objects (most often widgets inside a container, but also e.g.
/// actions in an action group, or columns in a tree model). A &lt;child&gt;
/// element contains an &lt;object&gt; element which describes the child object.
/// The target toolkit `version(s)` are described by &lt;requires&gt; elements,
/// the “lib” attribute specifies the widget library in question (currently
/// the only supported value is “gtk+”) and the “version” attribute specifies
/// the target version in the form “&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;”. The builder will error
/// out if the version requirements are not met.
/// 
/// Typically, the specific kind of object represented by an &lt;object&gt;
/// element is specified by the “class” attribute. If the type has not
/// been loaded yet, GTK+ tries to find the `get_type()` function from the
/// class name by applying heuristics. This works in most cases, but if
/// necessary, it is possible to specify the name of the `get_type()` function
/// explictly with the "type-func" attribute. As a special case, GtkBuilder
/// allows to use an object that has been constructed by a `GtkUIManager` in
/// another part of the UI definition by specifying the id of the `GtkUIManager`
/// in the “constructor” attribute and the name of the object in the “id”
/// attribute.
/// 
/// Objects may be given a name with the “id” attribute, which allows the
/// application to retrieve them from the builder with `gtk_builder_get_object()`.
/// An id is also necessary to use the object as property value in other
/// parts of the UI definition. GTK+ reserves ids starting and ending
/// with ___ (3 underscores) for its own purposes.
/// 
/// Setting properties of objects is pretty straightforward with the
/// &lt;property&gt; element: the “name” attribute specifies the name of the
/// property, and the content of the element specifies the value.
/// If the “translatable” attribute is set to a true value, GTK+ uses
/// `gettext()` (or `dgettext()` if the builder has a translation domain set)
/// to find a translation for the value. This happens before the value
/// is parsed, so it can be used for properties of any type, but it is
/// probably most useful for string properties. It is also possible to
/// specify a context to disambiguate short strings, and comments which
/// may help the translators.
/// 
/// GtkBuilder can parse textual representations for the most common
/// property types: characters, strings, integers, floating-point numbers,
/// booleans (strings like “TRUE”, “t”, “yes”, “y”, “1” are interpreted
/// as `true`, strings like “FALSE”, “f”, “no”, “n”, “0” are interpreted
/// as `false`), enumerations (can be specified by their name, nick or
/// integer value), flags (can be specified by their name, nick, integer
/// value, optionally combined with “|”, e.g. “GTK_VISIBLE|GTK_REALIZED”)
/// and colors (in a format understood by `gdk_rgba_parse()`).
/// 
/// GVariants can be specified in the format understood by `g_variant_parse()`,
/// and pixbufs can be specified as a filename of an image file to load.
/// 
/// Objects can be referred to by their name and by default refer to
/// objects declared in the local xml fragment and objects exposed via
/// `gtk_builder_expose_object()`. In general, GtkBuilder allows forward
/// references to objects — declared in the local xml; an object doesn’t
/// have to be constructed before it can be referred to. The exception
/// to this rule is that an object has to be constructed before it can
/// be used as the value of a construct-only property.
/// 
/// It is also possible to bind a property value to another object's
/// property value using the attributes
/// "bind-source" to specify the source object of the binding,
/// "bind-property" to specify the source property and optionally
/// "bind-flags" to specify the binding flags.
/// Internally builder implements this using GBinding objects.
/// For more information see `g_object_bind_property()`
/// 
/// Signal handlers are set up with the &lt;signal&gt; element. The “name”
/// attribute specifies the name of the signal, and the “handler” attribute
/// specifies the function to connect to the signal. By default, GTK+ tries
/// to find the handler using `g_module_symbol()`, but this can be changed by
/// passing a custom `GtkBuilderConnectFunc` to
/// `gtk_builder_connect_signals_full()`. The remaining attributes, “after”,
/// “swapped” and “object”, have the same meaning as the corresponding
/// parameters of the `g_signal_connect_object()` or
/// `g_signal_connect_data()` functions. A “last_modification_time”
/// attribute is also allowed, but it does not have a meaning to the
/// builder.
/// 
/// Sometimes it is necessary to refer to widgets which have implicitly
/// been constructed by GTK+ as part of a composite widget, to set
/// properties on them or to add further children (e.g. the `vbox` of
/// a `GtkDialog`). This can be achieved by setting the “internal-child”
/// property of the &lt;child&gt; element to a true value. Note that GtkBuilder
/// still requires an &lt;object&gt; element for the internal child, even if it
/// has already been constructed.
/// 
/// A number of widgets have different places where a child can be added
/// (e.g. tabs vs. page content in notebooks). This can be reflected in
/// a UI definition by specifying the “type” attribute on a &lt;child&gt;
/// The possible values for the “type” attribute are described in the
/// sections describing the widget-specific portions of UI definitions.

/// (multiple) calls to `gtk_builder_add_from_file()`,
/// `gtk_builder_add_from_resource()` or `gtk_builder_add_from_string()`.
/// 
/// A GtkBuilder holds a reference to all objects that it has constructed
/// and drops these references when it is finalized. This finalization can
/// cause the destruction of non-widget objects or widgets which are not
/// contained in a toplevel window. For toplevel windows constructed by a
/// builder, it is the responsibility of the user to call `gtk_widget_destroy()`
/// to get rid of them and all the widgets they contain.
/// 
/// The functions `gtk_builder_get_object()` and `gtk_builder_get_objects()`
/// can be used to access the widgets in the interface by the names assigned
/// to them inside the UI description. Toplevel windows returned by these
/// functions will stay around until the user explicitly destroys them
/// with `gtk_widget_destroy()`. Other widgets will either be part of a
/// larger hierarchy constructed by the builder (in which case you should
/// not have to worry about their lifecycle), or without a parent, in which
/// case they have to be added to some container to make use of them.
/// Non-widget objects need to be reffed with `g_object_ref()` to keep them
/// beyond the lifespan of the builder.
/// 
/// The function `gtk_builder_connect_signals()` and variants thereof can be
/// used to connect handlers to the named signals in the description.
/// 
/// # GtkBuilder UI Definitions # <a name="BUILDER-UI"></a>
/// 
/// GtkBuilder parses textual descriptions of user interfaces which are
/// specified in an XML format which can be roughly described by the
/// RELAX NG schema below. We refer to these descriptions as “GtkBuilder
/// UI definitions” or just “UI definitions” if the context is clear.
/// Do not confuse GtkBuilder UI Definitions with
/// [GtkUIManager UI Definitions](#XML-UI), which are more limited in scope.
/// It is common to use `.ui` as the filename extension for files containing
/// GtkBuilder UI definitions.
/// 
/// [RELAX NG Compact Syntax](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/blob/gtk-3-24/gtk/gtkbuilder.rnc)
/// 
/// The toplevel element is &lt;interface&gt;. It optionally takes a “domain”
/// attribute, which will make the builder look for translated strings
/// using `dgettext()` in the domain specified. This can also be done by
/// calling `gtk_builder_set_translation_domain()` on the builder.
/// Objects are described by &lt;object&gt; elements, which can contain
/// &lt;property&gt; elements to set properties, &lt;signal&gt; elements which
/// connect signals to handlers, and &lt;child&gt; elements, which describe
/// child objects (most often widgets inside a container, but also e.g.
/// actions in an action group, or columns in a tree model). A &lt;child&gt;
/// element contains an &lt;object&gt; element which describes the child object.
/// The target toolkit `version(s)` are described by &lt;requires&gt; elements,
/// the “lib” attribute specifies the widget library in question (currently
/// the only supported value is “gtk+”) and the “version” attribute specifies
/// the target version in the form “&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;”. The builder will error
/// out if the version requirements are not met.
/// 
/// Typically, the specific kind of object represented by an &lt;object&gt;
/// element is specified by the “class” attribute. If the type has not
/// been loaded yet, GTK+ tries to find the `get_type()` function from the
/// class name by applying heuristics. This works in most cases, but if
/// necessary, it is possible to specify the name of the `get_type()` function
/// explictly with the "type-func" attribute. As a special case, GtkBuilder
/// allows to use an object that has been constructed by a `GtkUIManager` in
/// another part of the UI definition by specifying the id of the `GtkUIManager`
/// in the “constructor” attribute and the name of the object in the “id”
/// attribute.
/// 
/// Objects may be given a name with the “id” attribute, which allows the
/// application to retrieve them from the builder with `gtk_builder_get_object()`.
/// An id is also necessary to use the object as property value in other
/// parts of the UI definition. GTK+ reserves ids starting and ending
/// with ___ (3 underscores) for its own purposes.
/// 
/// Setting properties of objects is pretty straightforward with the
/// &lt;property&gt; element: the “name” attribute specifies the name of the
/// property, and the content of the element specifies the value.
/// If the “translatable” attribute is set to a true value, GTK+ uses
/// `gettext()` (or `dgettext()` if the builder has a translation domain set)
/// to find a translation for the value. This happens before the value
/// is parsed, so it can be used for properties of any type, but it is
/// probably most useful for string properties. It is also possible to
/// specify a context to disambiguate short strings, and comments which
/// may help the translators.
/// 
/// GtkBuilder can parse textual representations for the most common
/// property types: characters, strings, integers, floating-point numbers,
/// booleans (strings like “TRUE”, “t”, “yes”, “y”, “1” are interpreted
/// as `true`, strings like “FALSE”, “f”, “no”, “n”, “0” are interpreted
/// as `false`), enumerations (can be specified by their name, nick or
/// integer value), flags (can be specified by their name, nick, integer
/// value, optionally combined with “|”, e.g. “GTK_VISIBLE|GTK_REALIZED”)
/// and colors (in a format understood by `gdk_rgba_parse()`).
/// 
/// GVariants can be specified in the format understood by `g_variant_parse()`,
/// and pixbufs can be specified as a filename of an image file to load.
/// 
/// Objects can be referred to by their name and by default refer to
/// objects declared in the local xml fragment and objects exposed via
/// `gtk_builder_expose_object()`. In general, GtkBuilder allows forward
/// references to objects — declared in the local xml; an object doesn’t
/// have to be constructed before it can be referred to. The exception
/// to this rule is that an object has to be constructed before it can
/// be used as the value of a construct-only property.
/// 
/// It is also possible to bind a property value to another object's
/// property value using the attributes
/// "bind-source" to specify the source object of the binding,
/// "bind-property" to specify the source property and optionally
/// "bind-flags" to specify the binding flags.
/// Internally builder implements this using GBinding objects.
/// For more information see `g_object_bind_property()`
/// 
/// Signal handlers are set up with the &lt;signal&gt; element. The “name”
/// attribute specifies the name of the signal, and the “handler” attribute
/// specifies the function to connect to the signal. By default, GTK+ tries
/// to find the handler using `g_module_symbol()`, but this can be changed by
/// passing a custom `GtkBuilderConnectFunc` to
/// `gtk_builder_connect_signals_full()`. The remaining attributes, “after”,
/// “swapped” and “object”, have the same meaning as the corresponding
/// parameters of the `g_signal_connect_object()` or
/// `g_signal_connect_data()` functions. A “last_modification_time”
/// attribute is also allowed, but it does not have a meaning to the
/// builder.
/// 
/// Sometimes it is necessary to refer to widgets which have implicitly
/// been constructed by GTK+ as part of a composite widget, to set
/// properties on them or to add further children (e.g. the `vbox` of
/// a `GtkDialog`). This can be achieved by setting the “internal-child”
/// property of the &lt;child&gt; element to a true value. Note that GtkBuilder
/// still requires an &lt;object&gt; element for the internal child, even if it
/// has already been constructed.
/// 
/// A number of widgets have different places where a child can be added
/// (e.g. tabs vs. page content in notebooks). This can be reflected in
/// a UI definition by specifying the “type” attribute on a &lt;child&gt;
/// The possible values for the “type” attribute are described in the
/// sections describing the widget-specific portions of UI definitions.
/// 
/// # A GtkBuilder UI Definition

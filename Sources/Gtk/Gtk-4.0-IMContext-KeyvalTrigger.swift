// MARK: - IMContext Class

/// The `IMContextProtocol` protocol exposes the methods and properties of an underlying `GtkIMContext` instance.
/// The default implementation of these can be found in the protocol extension below.
/// For a concrete class that implements these methods and properties, see `IMContext`.
/// Alternatively, use `IMContextRef` as a lighweight, `unowned` reference if you already have an instance you just want to use.
///
/// `GtkIMContext` defines the interface for GTK input methods. An input method
/// is used by GTK text input widgets like `GtkEntry` to map from key events to
/// Unicode character strings.
/// 
/// The default input method can be set programmatically via the
/// `GtkSettings:gtk`-im-module GtkSettings property. Alternatively, you may set
/// the GTK_IM_MODULE environment variable as documented in
/// [Running GTK Applications](#gtk-running).
/// 
/// The `GtkEntry` `GtkEntry:im`-module and `GtkTextView` `GtkTextView:im`-module
/// properties may also be used to set input methods for specific widget
/// instances. For instance, a certain entry widget might be expected to contain
/// certain characters which would be easier to input with a certain input
/// method.
/// 
/// An input method may consume multiple key events in sequence and finally
/// output the composed result. This is called preediting, and an input method
/// may provide feedback about this process by displaying the intermediate
/// composition states as preedit text. For instance, the default GTK input
/// method implements the input of arbitrary Unicode code points by holding down
/// the Control and Shift keys and then typing “U” followed by the hexadecimal
/// digits of the code point.  When releasing the Control and Shift keys,
/// preediting ends and the character is inserted as text. Ctrl+Shift+u20AC for
/// example results in the € sign.
/// 
/// Additional input methods can be made available for use by GTK widgets as
/// loadable modules. An input method module is a small shared library which
/// implements a subclass of `GtkIMContext` or `GtkIMContextSimple` and exports
/// these four functions:
/// 
/// (C Language Example):
/// ```C
/// void im_module_init(GTypeModule *module);
/// ```
/// This function should register the `GType` of the `GtkIMContext` subclass which
/// implements the input method by means of `g_type_module_register_type()`. Note
/// that `g_type_register_static()` cannot be used as the type needs to be
/// registered dynamically.
/// 
/// (C Language Example):
/// ```C
/// void im_module_exit(void);
/// ```
/// Here goes any cleanup code your input method might require on module unload.
/// 
/// (C Language Example):
/// ```C
/// void im_module_list(const GtkIMContextInfo ***contexts, int *n_contexts)
/// {
///   *contexts = info_list;
///   *n_contexts = G_N_ELEMENTS (info_list);
/// }
/// ```
/// This function returns the list of input methods provided by the module. The
/// example implementation above shows a common solution and simply returns a
/// pointer to statically defined array of `GtkIMContextInfo` items for each
/// provided input method.
/// 
/// (C Language Example):
/// ```C
/// GtkIMContext * im_module_create(const char *context_id);
/// ```
/// This function should return a pointer to a newly created instance of the
/// `GtkIMContext` subclass identified by `context_id`. The context ID is the same
/// as specified in the `GtkIMContextInfo` array returned by `im_module_list()`.
/// 
/// After a new loadable input method module has been installed on the system,
/// the configuration file `gtk.immodules` needs to be
/// regenerated by [gtk-query-immodules-3.0](#gtk-query-immodules-3.0),
/// in order for the new input method to become available to GTK applications.

///
/// `GtkIconTheme` provides a facility for looking up icons by name
/// and size. The main reason for using a name rather than simply
/// providing a filename is to allow different icons to be used
/// depending on what “icon theme” is selected
/// by the user. The operation of icon themes on Linux and Unix
/// follows the [Icon Theme Specification](http://www.freedesktop.org/Standards/icon-theme-spec)
/// There is a fallback icon theme, named `hicolor`, where applications
/// should install their icons, but additional icon themes can be installed
/// as operating system vendors and users choose.
/// 
/// In many cases, named themes are used indirectly, via `GtkImage`
/// rather than directly, but looking up icons
/// directly is also simple. The `GtkIconTheme` object acts
/// as a database of all the icons in the current theme. You
/// can create new `GtkIconTheme` objects, but it’s much more
/// efficient to use the standard icon theme of the `GtkWidget`
/// so that the icon information is shared with other people
/// looking up icons.
/// (C Language Example):
/// ```C
/// GtkIconTheme *icon_theme;
/// GtkIconPaintable *icon;
/// GdkPaintable *paintable;
/// 
/// icon_theme = gtk_icon_theme_get_for_display (gtk_widget_get_display (my_widget));

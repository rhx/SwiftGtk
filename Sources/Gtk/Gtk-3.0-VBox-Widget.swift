// MARK: - Widget Class

/// GtkWidget is the base class all widgets in GTK+ derive from. It manages the
/// widget lifecycle, states and style.
/// 
/// # Height-for-width Geometry Management # <a name="geometry-management"></a>
/// 
/// GTK+ uses a height-for-width (and width-for-height) geometry management
/// system. Height-for-width means that a widget can change how much
/// vertical space it needs, depending on the amount of horizontal space
/// that it is given (and similar for width-for-height). The most common
/// example is a label that reflows to fill up the available width, wraps
/// to fewer lines, and therefore needs less height.
/// 
/// Height-for-width geometry management is implemented in GTK+ by way
/// of five virtual methods:
/// 
/// - `GtkWidgetClass.get_request_mode``()`
/// - `GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_width``()`
/// - `GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_height``()`
/// - `GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_height_for_width``()`
/// - `GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_width_for_height``()`
/// - `GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_height_and_baseline_for_width``()`
/// 
/// There are some important things to keep in mind when implementing
/// height-for-width and when using it in container implementations.
/// 
/// The geometry management system will query a widget hierarchy in
/// only one orientation at a time. When widgets are initially queried
/// for their minimum sizes it is generally done in two initial passes
/// in the `GtkSizeRequestMode` chosen by the toplevel.
/// 
/// For example, when queried in the normal
/// `GTK_SIZE_REQUEST_HEIGHT_FOR_WIDTH` mode:
/// First, the default minimum and natural width for each widget
/// in the interface will be computed using `gtk_widget_get_preferred_width()`.
/// Because the preferred widths for each container depend on the preferred
/// widths of their children, this information propagates up the hierarchy,
/// and finally a minimum and natural width is determined for the entire
/// toplevel. Next, the toplevel will use the minimum width to query for the
/// minimum height contextual to that width using
/// `gtk_widget_get_preferred_height_for_width()`, which will also be a highly
/// recursive operation. The minimum height for the minimum width is normally
/// used to set the minimum size constraint on the toplevel
/// (unless `gtk_window_set_geometry_hints()` is explicitly used instead).
/// 
/// After the toplevel window has initially requested its size in both
/// dimensions it can go on to allocate itself a reasonable size (or a size
/// previously specified with `gtk_window_set_default_size()`). During the
/// recursive allocation process it’s important to note that request cycles
/// will be recursively executed while container widgets allocate their children.
/// Each container widget, once allocated a size, will go on to first share the
/// space in one orientation among its children and then request each child's
/// height for its target allocated width or its width for allocated height,
/// depending. In this way a `GtkWidget` will typically be requested its size
/// a number of times before actually being allocated a size. The size a
/// widget is finally allocated can of course differ from the size it has
/// requested. For this reason, `GtkWidget` caches a  small number of results
/// to avoid re-querying for the same sizes in one allocation cycle.
/// 
/// See
/// [GtkContainer’s geometry management section](#container-geometry-management)
/// to learn more about how height-for-width allocations are performed
/// by container widgets.
/// 
/// If a widget does move content around to intelligently use up the
/// allocated size then it must support the request in both
/// `GtkSizeRequestModes` even if the widget in question only
/// trades sizes in a single orientation.
/// 
/// For instance, a `GtkLabel` that does height-for-width word wrapping
/// will not expect to have `GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_height``()` called
/// because that call is specific to a width-for-height request. In this
/// case the label must return the height required for its own minimum
/// possible width. By following this rule any widget that handles
/// height-for-width or width-for-height requests will always be allocated
/// at least enough space to fit its own content.
/// 
/// Here are some examples of how a `GTK_SIZE_REQUEST_HEIGHT_FOR_WIDTH` widget
/// generally deals with width-for-height requests, for `GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_height``()`
/// it will do:
/// 
/// (C Language Example):
/// ```C
/// static void
/// foo_widget_get_preferred_height (GtkWidget *widget,
///                                  gint *min_height,

///                                                            &nat_width);
///        GTK_WIDGET_GET_CLASS (widget)->get_preferred_height_for_width
///                                                           (widget,
///                                                            min_width,
///                                                            min_height,
///                                                            nat_height);
///      }
///    else
///      {
///         ... some widgets do both. For instance, if a GtkLabel is
///         rotated to 90 degrees it will return the minimum and
///         natural height for the rotated label here.
///      }
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// And in `GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_width_for_height``()` it will simply return

/// (C Language Example):
/// ```C
/// static void
/// foo_widget_get_preferred_width_for_height (GtkWidget *widget,
///                                            gint for_height,
///                                            gint *min_width,
///                                            gint *nat_width)
/// {
///    if (i_am_in_height_for_width_mode)
///      {
///        GTK_WIDGET_GET_CLASS (widget)->get_preferred_width (widget,
///                                                            min_width,
///                                                            nat_width);
///      }
///    else
///      {
///         ... again if a widget is sometimes operating in
///         width-for-height mode (like a rotated GtkLabel) it can go
///         ahead and do its real width for height calculation here.
///      }
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// Often a widget needs to get its own request during size request or
/// allocation. For example, when computing height it may need to also
/// compute width. Or when deciding how to use an allocation, the widget
/// may need to know its natural size. In these cases, the widget should
/// be careful to call its virtual methods directly, like this:
/// 
/// (C Language Example):
/// ```C
/// GTK_WIDGET_GET_CLASS(widget)->get_preferred_width (widget,
///                                                    &min,
///                                                    &natural);
/// ```
/// 
/// It will not work to use the wrapper functions, such as
/// `gtk_widget_get_preferred_width()` inside your own size request
/// implementation. These return a request adjusted by `GtkSizeGroup`
/// and by the `GtkWidgetClass.adjust_size_request``()` virtual method. If a
/// widget used the wrappers inside its virtual method implementations,
/// then the adjustments (such as widget margins) would be applied
/// twice. GTK+ therefore does not allow this and will warn if you try
/// to do it.
/// 
/// Of course if you are getting the size request for
/// another widget, such as a child of a
/// container, you must use the wrapper APIs.
/// Otherwise, you would not properly consider widget margins,
/// `GtkSizeGroup`, and so forth.
/// 
/// Since 3.10 GTK+ also supports baseline vertical alignment of widgets. This
/// means that widgets are positioned such that the typographical baseline of
/// widgets in the same row are aligned. This happens if a widget supports baselines,
/// has a vertical alignment of `GTK_ALIGN_BASELINE`, and is inside a container
/// that supports baselines and has a natural “row” that it aligns to the baseline,
/// or a baseline assigned to it by the grandparent.
/// 
/// Baseline alignment support for a widget is done by the `GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_height_and_baseline_for_width``()`
/// virtual function. It allows you to report a baseline in combination with the
/// minimum and natural height. If there is no baseline you can return -1 to indicate
/// this. The default implementation of this virtual function calls into the
/// `GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_height``()` and `GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_height_for_width``()`,
/// so if baselines are not supported it doesn’t need to be implemented.
/// 
/// If a widget ends up baseline aligned it will be allocated all the space in the parent
/// as if it was `GTK_ALIGN_FILL`, but the selected baseline can be found via `gtk_widget_get_allocated_baseline()`.
/// If this has a value other than -1 you need to align the widget such that the baseline
/// appears at the position.
/// 
/// # Style Properties
/// 
/// `GtkWidget` introduces “style
/// properties” - these are basically object properties that are stored
/// not on the object, but in the style object associated to the widget. Style
/// properties are set in [resource files](#gtk3-Resource-Files).
/// This mechanism is used for configuring such things as the location of the
/// scrollbar arrows through the theme, giving theme authors more control over the
/// look of applications without the need to write a theme engine in C.
/// 
/// Use `gtk_widget_class_install_style_property()` to install style properties for
/// a widget class, `gtk_widget_class_find_style_property()` or
/// `gtk_widget_class_list_style_properties()` to get information about existing
/// style properties and `gtk_widget_style_get_property()`, `gtk_widget_style_get()` or
/// `gtk_widget_style_get_valist()` to obtain the value of a style property.
/// 
/// # GtkWidget as GtkBuildable
/// 
/// The GtkWidget implementation of the GtkBuildable interface supports a
/// custom &lt;accelerator&gt; element, which has attributes named ”key”, ”modifiers”
/// and ”signal” and allows to specify accelerators.
/// 
/// An example of a UI definition fragment specifying an accelerator:
/// ```
/// <object class="GtkButton">
///   <accelerator key="q" modifiers="GDK_CONTROL_MASK" signal="clicked"/>
/// </object>
/// ```
/// 
/// In addition to accelerators, GtkWidget also support a custom &lt;accessible&gt;
/// element, which supports actions and relations. Properties on the accessible
/// implementation of an object can be set by accessing the internal child
/// “accessible” of a `GtkWidget`.
/// 
/// An example of a UI definition fragment specifying an accessible:
/// ```
/// <object class="GtkLabel" id="label1"/>
///   <property name="label">I am a Label for a Button</property>
/// </object>
/// <object class="GtkButton" id="button1">
///   <accessibility>
///     <action action_name="click" translatable="yes">Click the button.</action>
///     <relation target="label1" type="labelled-by"/>
///   </accessibility>
///   <child internal-child="accessible">
///     <object class="AtkObject" id="a11y-button1">
///       <property name="accessible-name">Clickable Button</property>
///     </object>
///   </child>
/// </object>
/// ```
/// 
/// Finally, GtkWidget allows style information such as style classes to
/// be associated with widgets, using the custom &lt;style&gt; element:
/// ```
/// <object class="GtkButton" id="button1">
///   <style>
///     <class name="my-special-button-class"/>
///     <class name="dark-button"/>
///   </style>
/// </object>
/// ```
/// 
/// # Building composite widgets from template XML ## <a name="composite-templates"></a>
/// 
/// GtkWidget exposes some facilities to automate the procedure
/// of creating composite widgets using `GtkBuilder` interface description
/// language.
/// 
/// To create composite widgets with `GtkBuilder` XML, one must associate
/// the interface description with the widget class at class initialization
/// time using `gtk_widget_class_set_template()`.
/// 
/// The interface description semantics expected in composite template descriptions
/// is slightly different from regular `GtkBuilder` XML.
/// 
/// Unlike regular interface descriptions, `gtk_widget_class_set_template()` will
/// expect a &lt;template&gt; tag as a direct child of the toplevel &lt;interface&gt;
/// tag. The &lt;template&gt; tag must specify the “class” attribute which must be
/// the type name of the widget. Optionally, the “parent” attribute may be
/// specified to specify the direct parent type of the widget type, this is
/// ignored by the GtkBuilder but required for Glade to introspect what kind
/// of properties and internal children exist for a given type when the actual
/// type does not exist.
/// 
/// The XML which is contained inside the &lt;template&gt; tag behaves as if it were
/// added to the &lt;object&gt; tag defining `widget` itself. You may set properties
/// on `widget` by inserting &lt;property&gt; tags into the &lt;template&gt; tag, and also
/// add &lt;child&gt; tags to add children and extend `widget` in the normal way you
/// would with &lt;object&gt; tags.
/// 
/// Additionally, &lt;object&gt; tags can also be added before and after the initial
/// &lt;template&gt; tag in the normal way, allowing one to define auxiliary objects
/// which might be referenced by other widgets declared as children of the
/// &lt;template&gt; tag.
/// 
/// An example of a GtkBuilder Template Definition:
/// ```
/// <interface>
///   <template class="FooWidget" parent="GtkBox">
///     <property name="orientation">GTK_ORIENTATION_HORIZONTAL</property>
///     <property name="spacing">4</property>
///     <child>
///       <object class="GtkButton" id="hello_button">
///         <property name="label">Hello World</property>
///         <signal name="clicked" handler="hello_button_clicked" object="FooWidget" swapped="yes"/>
///       </object>
///     </child>
///     <child>
///       <object class="GtkButton" id="goodbye_button">
///         <property name="label">Goodbye World</property>
///       </object>
///     </child>
///   </template>
/// </interface>
/// ```
/// 
/// Typically, you'll place the template fragment into a file that is
/// bundled with your project, using `GResource`. In order to load the
/// template, you need to call `gtk_widget_class_set_template_from_resource()`
/// from the class initialization of your `GtkWidget` type:

/// foo_widget_class_init (FooWidgetClass *klass)
/// {
///   // ...
/// 
///   gtk_widget_class_set_template_from_resource (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),

/// }
/// ```

///   // ...
///   gtk_widget_init_template (GTK_WIDGET (self));
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// You can access widgets defined in the template using the

/// # Height-for-width Geometry Management # <a name="geometry-management"></a>
/// 
/// GTK+ uses a height-for-width (and width-for-height) geometry management
/// system. Height-for-width means that a widget can change how much
/// vertical space it needs, depending on the amount of horizontal space
/// that it is given (and similar for width-for-height). The most common
/// example is a label that reflows to fill up the available width, wraps
/// to fewer lines, and therefore needs less height.
/// 
/// Height-for-width geometry management is implemented in GTK+ by way
/// of five virtual methods:
/// 
/// - `GtkWidgetClass.get_request_mode``()`
/// - `GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_width``()`
/// - `GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_height``()`
/// - `GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_height_for_width``()`
/// - `GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_width_for_height``()`
/// - `GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_height_and_baseline_for_width``()`
/// 
/// There are some important things to keep in mind when implementing
/// height-for-width and when using it in container implementations.
/// 
/// The geometry management system will query a widget hierarchy in
/// only one orientation at a time. When widgets are initially queried
/// for their minimum sizes it is generally done in two initial passes
/// in the `GtkSizeRequestMode` chosen by the toplevel.
/// 
/// For example, when queried in the normal
/// `GTK_SIZE_REQUEST_HEIGHT_FOR_WIDTH` mode:
/// First, the default minimum and natural width for each widget
/// in the interface will be computed using `gtk_widget_get_preferred_width()`.
/// Because the preferred widths for each container depend on the preferred
/// widths of their children, this information propagates up the hierarchy,
/// and finally a minimum and natural width is determined for the entire
/// toplevel. Next, the toplevel will use the minimum width to query for the
/// minimum height contextual to that width using
/// `gtk_widget_get_preferred_height_for_width()`, which will also be a highly
/// recursive operation. The minimum height for the minimum width is normally
/// used to set the minimum size constraint on the toplevel
/// (unless `gtk_window_set_geometry_hints()` is explicitly used instead).
/// 
/// After the toplevel window has initially requested its size in both
/// dimensions it can go on to allocate itself a reasonable size (or a size
/// previously specified with `gtk_window_set_default_size()`). During the
/// recursive allocation process it’s important to note that request cycles
/// will be recursively executed while container widgets allocate their children.
/// Each container widget, once allocated a size, will go on to first share the
/// space in one orientation among its children and then request each child's
/// height for its target allocated width or its width for allocated height,
/// depending. In this way a `GtkWidget` will typically be requested its size
/// a number of times before actually being allocated a size. The size a
/// widget is finally allocated can of course differ from the size it has
/// requested. For this reason, `GtkWidget` caches a  small number of results
/// to avoid re-querying for the same sizes in one allocation cycle.
/// 
/// See
/// [GtkContainer’s geometry management section](#container-geometry-management)
/// to learn more about how height-for-width allocations are performed
/// by container widgets.
/// 
/// If a widget does move content around to intelligently use up the
/// allocated size then it must support the request in both
/// `GtkSizeRequestModes` even if the widget in question only
/// trades sizes in a single orientation.
/// 
/// For instance, a `GtkLabel` that does height-for-width word wrapping
/// will not expect to have `GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_height``()` called
/// because that call is specific to a width-for-height request. In this
/// case the label must return the height required for its own minimum
/// possible width. By following this rule any widget that handles
/// height-for-width or width-for-height requests will always be allocated
/// at least enough space to fit its own content.
/// 
/// Here are some examples of how a `GTK_SIZE_REQUEST_HEIGHT_FOR_WIDTH` widget
/// generally deals with width-for-height requests, for `GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_height``()`
/// it will do:
/// 
/// (C Language Example):
/// ```C
/// static void
/// foo_widget_get_preferred_height (GtkWidget *widget,

///                                                            &nat_width);

///                                                            nat_height);
///      }

///      {
///         ... some widgets do both. For instance, if a GtkLabel is

///      }
/// }
/// ```
///

///                                            gint *min_width,
///                                            gint *nat_width)

///                                                            nat_width);
///      }
///    else
///      {
///         ... again if a widget is sometimes operating in
///         width-for-height mode (like a rotated GtkLabel) it can go
///         ahead and do its real width for height calculation here.
///      }
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// Often a widget needs to get its own request during size request or
/// allocation. For example, when computing height it may need to also
/// compute width. Or when deciding how to use an allocation, the widget
/// may need to know its natural size. In these cases, the widget should
/// be careful to call its virtual methods directly, like this:
/// 
/// (C Language Example):
/// ```C
/// GTK_WIDGET_GET_CLASS(widget)->get_preferred_width (widget,
///                                                    &min,
///                                                    &natural);
/// ```
/// 
/// It will not work to use the wrapper functions, such as
/// `gtk_widget_get_preferred_width()` inside your own size request
/// implementation. These return a request adjusted by `GtkSizeGroup`
/// and by the `GtkWidgetClass.adjust_size_request``()` virtual method. If a
/// widget used the wrappers inside its virtual method implementations,
/// then the adjustments (such as widget margins) would be applied
/// twice. GTK+ therefore does not allow this and will warn if you try
/// to do it.
/// 
/// Of course if you are getting the size request for
/// another widget, such as a child of a
/// container, you must use the wrapper APIs.
/// Otherwise, you would not properly consider widget margins,
/// `GtkSizeGroup`, and so forth.
/// 
/// Since 3.10 GTK+ also supports baseline vertical alignment of widgets. This
/// means that widgets are positioned such that the typographical baseline of
/// widgets in the same row are aligned. This happens if a widget supports baselines,
/// has a vertical alignment of `GTK_ALIGN_BASELINE`, and is inside a container
/// that supports baselines and has a natural “row” that it aligns to the baseline,
/// or a baseline assigned to it by the grandparent.
/// 
/// Baseline alignment support for a widget is done by the `GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_height_and_baseline_for_width``()`
/// virtual function. It allows you to report a baseline in combination with the
/// minimum and natural height. If there is no baseline you can return -1 to indicate
/// this. The default implementation of this virtual function calls into the
/// `GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_height``()` and `GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_height_for_width``()`,
/// so if baselines are not supported it doesn’t need to be implemented.
/// 
/// If a widget ends up baseline aligned it will be allocated all the space in the parent
/// as if it was `GTK_ALIGN_FILL`, but the selected baseline can be found via `gtk_widget_get_allocated_baseline()`.
/// If this has a value other than -1 you need to align the widget such that the baseline
/// appears at the position.
/// 
/// # Style Properties
/// 
/// `GtkWidget` introduces “style
/// properties” - these are basically object properties that are stored
/// not on the object, but in the style object associated to the widget. Style
/// properties are set in [resource files](#gtk3-Resource-Files).
/// This mechanism is used for configuring such things as the location of the
/// scrollbar arrows through the theme, giving theme authors more control over the
/// look of applications without the need to write a theme engine in C.
/// 
/// Use `gtk_widget_class_install_style_property()` to install style properties for
/// a widget class, `gtk_widget_class_find_style_property()` or
/// `gtk_widget_class_list_style_properties()` to get information about existing
/// style properties and `gtk_widget_style_get_property()`, `gtk_widget_style_get()` or
/// `gtk_widget_style_get_valist()` to obtain the value of a style property.
/// 
/// # GtkWidget as GtkBuildable
/// 
/// The GtkWidget implementation of the GtkBuildable interface supports a
/// custom &lt;accelerator&gt; element, which has attributes named ”key”, ”modifiers”
/// and ”signal” and allows to specify accelerators.
/// 
/// An example of a UI definition fragment specifying an accelerator:
/// ```
/// <object class="GtkButton">
///   <accelerator key="q" modifiers="GDK_CONTROL_MASK" signal="clicked"/>
/// </object>
/// ```
/// 
/// In addition to accelerators, GtkWidget also support a custom &lt;accessible&gt;
/// element, which supports actions and relations. Properties on the accessible
/// implementation of an object can be set by accessing the internal child
/// “accessible” of a `GtkWidget`.
/// 
/// An example of a UI definition fragment specifying an accessible:
/// ```
/// <object class="GtkLabel" id="label1"/>
///   <property name="label">I am a Label for a Button</property>
/// </object>
/// <object class="GtkButton" id="button1">
///   <accessibility>
///     <action action_name="click" translatable="yes">Click the button.</action>
///     <relation target="label1" type="labelled-by"/>
///   </accessibility>
///   <child internal-child="accessible">
///     <object class="AtkObject" id="a11y-button1">
///       <property name="accessible-name">Clickable Button</property>
///     </object>
///   </child>
/// </object>
/// ```
/// 
/// Finally, GtkWidget allows style information such as style classes to
/// be associated with widgets, using the custom &lt;style&gt; element:
/// ```
/// <object class="GtkButton" id="button1">
///   <style>
///     <class name="my-special-button-class"/>
///     <class name="dark-button"/>
///   </style>
/// </object>
/// ```
/// 
/// # Building composite widgets from template XML ## <a name="composite-templates"></a>
/// 
/// GtkWidget exposes some facilities to automate the procedure
/// of creating composite widgets using `GtkBuilder` interface description
/// language.
/// 
/// To create composite widgets with `GtkBuilder` XML, one must associate
/// the interface description with the widget class at class initialization
/// time using `gtk_widget_class_set_template()`.
/// 
/// The interface description semantics expected in composite template descriptions
/// is slightly different from regular `GtkBuilder` XML.
/// 
/// Unlike regular interface descriptions, `gtk_widget_class_set_template()` will
/// expect a &lt;template&gt; tag as a direct child of the toplevel &lt;interface&gt;
/// tag. The &lt;template&gt; tag must specify the “class” attribute which must be
/// the type name of the widget. Optionally, the “parent” attribute may be
/// specified to specify the direct parent type of the widget type, this is
/// ignored by the GtkBuilder but required for Glade to introspect what kind
/// of properties and internal children exist for a given type when the actual
/// type does not exist.
/// 
/// The XML which is contained inside the &lt;template&gt; tag behaves as if it were
/// added to the &lt;object&gt; tag defining `widget` itself. You may set properties
/// on `widget` by inserting &lt;property&gt; tags into the &lt;template&gt; tag, and also
/// add &lt;child&gt; tags to add children and extend `widget` in the normal way you
/// would with &lt;object&gt; tags.
/// 
/// Additionally, &lt;object&gt; tags can also be added before and after the initial
/// &lt;template&gt; tag in the normal way, allowing one to define auxiliary objects
/// which might be referenced by other widgets declared as children of the
/// &lt;template&gt; tag.
/// 
/// An example of a GtkBuilder Template Definition:
/// ```
/// <interface>
///   <template class="FooWidget" parent="GtkBox">
///     <property name="orientation">GTK_ORIENTATION_HORIZONTAL</property>
///     <property name="spacing">4</property>
///     <child>
///       <object class="GtkButton" id="hello_button">
///         <property name="label">Hello World</property>
///         <signal name="clicked" handler="hello_button_clicked" object="FooWidget" swapped="yes"/>
///       </object>
///     </child>
///     <child>
///       <object class="GtkButton" id="goodbye_button">
///         <property name="label">Goodbye World</property>
///       </object>
///     </child>
///   </template>
/// </interface>
/// ```
/// 
/// Typically, you'll place the template fragment into a file that is
/// bundled with your project, using `GResource`. In order to load the
/// template, you need to call `gtk_widget_class_set_template_from_resource()`
/// from the class initialization of your `GtkWidget` type:
/// 
/// (C Language Example):
/// ```C
/// static void
/// foo_widget_class_init (FooWidgetClass *klass)
/// {
///   // ...
/// 
///   gtk_widget_class_set_template_from_resource (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),

/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// You will also need to call `gtk_widget_init_template()` from the instance

/// ```
/// 
/// You can access widgets defined in the template using the

/// GtkWidget is the base class all widgets in GTK+ derive from. It manages the

/// 
/// # Height-for-width Geometry Management # <a name="geometry-management"></a>
/// 
/// GTK+ uses a height-for-width (and width-for-height) geometry management
/// system. Height-for-width means that a widget can change how much
/// vertical space it needs, depending on the amount of horizontal space
/// that it is given (and similar for width-for-height). The most common
/// example is a label that reflows to fill up the available width, wraps
/// to fewer lines, and therefore needs less height.
/// 
/// Height-for-width geometry management is implemented in GTK+ by way
/// of five virtual methods:
/// 
/// - `GtkWidgetClass.get_request_mode``()`
/// - `GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_width``()`
/// - `GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_height``()`
/// - `GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_height_for_width``()`
/// - `GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_width_for_height``()`
/// - `GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_height_and_baseline_for_width``()`
/// 
/// There are some important things to keep in mind when implementing
/// height-for-width and when using it in container implementations.
/// 
/// The geometry management system will query a widget hierarchy in
/// only one orientation at a time. When widgets are initially queried
/// for their minimum sizes it is generally done in two initial passes
/// in the `GtkSizeRequestMode` chosen by the toplevel.
/// 
/// For example, when queried in the normal
/// `GTK_SIZE_REQUEST_HEIGHT_FOR_WIDTH` mode:
/// First, the default minimum and natural width for each widget
/// in the interface will be computed using `gtk_widget_get_preferred_width()`.
/// Because the preferred widths for each container depend on the preferred
/// widths of their children, this information propagates up the hierarchy,
/// and finally a minimum and natural width is determined for the entire
/// toplevel. Next, the toplevel will use the minimum width to query for the
/// minimum height contextual to that width using
/// `gtk_widget_get_preferred_height_for_width()`, which will also be a highly
/// recursive operation. The minimum height for the minimum width is normally
/// used to set the minimum size constraint on the toplevel
/// (unless `gtk_window_set_geometry_hints()` is explicitly used instead).
/// 
/// After the toplevel window has initially requested its size in both
/// dimensions it can go on to allocate itself a reasonable size (or a size
/// previously specified with `gtk_window_set_default_size()`). During the
/// recursive allocation process it’s important to note that request cycles
/// will be recursively executed while container widgets allocate their children.
/// Each container widget, once allocated a size, will go on to first share the
/// space in one orientation among its children and then request each child's
/// height for its target allocated width or its width for allocated height,
/// depending. In this way a `GtkWidget` will typically be requested its size
/// a number of times before actually being allocated a size. The size a
/// widget is finally allocated can of course differ from the size it has
/// requested. For this reason, `GtkWidget` caches a  small number of results
/// to avoid re-querying for the same sizes in one allocation cycle.
/// 
/// See
/// [GtkContainer’s geometry management section](#container-geometry-management)
/// to learn more about how height-for-width allocations are performed
/// by container widgets.
/// 
/// If a widget does move content around to intelligently use up the
/// allocated size then it must support the request in both
/// `GtkSizeRequestModes` even if the widget in question only
/// trades sizes in a single orientation.
/// 
/// For instance, a `GtkLabel` that does height-for-width word wrapping
/// will not expect to have `GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_height``()` called
/// because that call is specific to a width-for-height request. In this
/// case the label must return the height required for its own minimum
/// possible width. By following this rule any widget that handles
/// height-for-width or width-for-height requests will always be allocated
/// at least enough space to fit its own content.
/// 
/// Here are some examples of how a `GTK_SIZE_REQUEST_HEIGHT_FOR_WIDTH` widget
/// generally deals with width-for-height requests, for `GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_height``()`
/// it will do:
/// 
/// (C Language Example):
/// ```C
/// static void
/// foo_widget_get_preferred_height (GtkWidget *widget,
///                                  gint *min_height,
///                                  gint *nat_height)
/// {
///    if (i_am_in_height_for_width_mode)
///      {
///        gint min_width, nat_width;
/// 
///        GTK_WIDGET_GET_CLASS (widget)->get_preferred_width (widget,
///                                                            &min_width,
///                                                            &nat_width);
///        GTK_WIDGET_GET_CLASS (widget)->get_preferred_height_for_width
///                                                           (widget,
///                                                            min_width,
///                                                            min_height,
///                                                            nat_height);
///      }
///    else
///      {
///         ... some widgets do both. For instance, if a GtkLabel is
///         rotated to 90 degrees it will return the minimum and
///         natural height for the rotated label here.
///      }
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// And in `GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_width_for_height``()` it will simply return
/// the minimum and natural width:
/// (C Language Example):
/// ```C
/// static void
/// foo_widget_get_preferred_width_for_height (GtkWidget *widget,
///                                            gint for_height,
///                                            gint *min_width,
///                                            gint *nat_width)
/// {
///    if (i_am_in_height_for_width_mode)
///      {
///        GTK_WIDGET_GET_CLASS (widget)->get_preferred_width (widget,
///                                                            min_width,
///                                                            nat_width);
///      }
///    else
///      {
///         ... again if a widget is sometimes operating in
///         width-for-height mode (like a rotated GtkLabel) it can go
///         ahead and do its real width for height calculation here.
///      }
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// Often a widget needs to get its own request during size request or
/// allocation. For example, when computing height it may need to also
/// compute width. Or when deciding how to use an allocation, the widget
/// may need to know its natural size. In these cases, the widget should
/// be careful to call its virtual methods directly, like this:
/// 
/// (C Language Example):
/// ```C
/// GTK_WIDGET_GET_CLASS(widget)->get_preferred_width (widget,
///                                                    &min,
///                                                    &natural);
/// ```
/// 
/// It will not work to use the wrapper functions, such as
/// `gtk_widget_get_preferred_width()` inside your own size request
/// implementation. These return a request adjusted by `GtkSizeGroup`
/// and by the `GtkWidgetClass.adjust_size_request``()` virtual method. If a
/// widget used the wrappers inside its virtual method implementations,
/// then the adjustments (such as widget margins) would be applied
/// twice. GTK+ therefore does not allow this and will warn if you try
/// to do it.
/// 
/// Of course if you are getting the size request for
/// another widget, such as a child of a
/// container, you must use the wrapper APIs.
/// Otherwise, you would not properly consider widget margins,
/// `GtkSizeGroup`, and so forth.
/// 
/// Since 3.10 GTK+ also supports baseline vertical alignment of widgets. This
/// means that widgets are positioned such that the typographical baseline of
/// widgets in the same row are aligned. This happens if a widget supports baselines,
/// has a vertical alignment of `GTK_ALIGN_BASELINE`, and is inside a container
/// that supports baselines and has a natural “row” that it aligns to the baseline,
/// or a baseline assigned to it by the grandparent.
/// 
/// Baseline alignment support for a widget is done by the `GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_height_and_baseline_for_width``()`
/// virtual function. It allows you to report a baseline in combination with the
/// minimum and natural height. If there is no baseline you can return -1 to indicate
/// this. The default implementation of this virtual function calls into the
/// `GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_height``()` and `GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_height_for_width``()`,
/// so if baselines are not supported it doesn’t need to be implemented.
/// 
/// If a widget ends up baseline aligned it will be allocated all the space in the parent
/// as if it was `GTK_ALIGN_FILL`, but the selected baseline can be found via `gtk_widget_get_allocated_baseline()`.
/// If this has a value other than -1 you need to align the widget such that the baseline
/// appears at the position.
/// 
/// # Style Properties
/// 
/// `GtkWidget` introduces “style
/// properties” - these are basically object properties that are stored
/// not on the object, but in the style object associated to the widget. Style
/// properties are set in [resource files](#gtk3-Resource-Files).
/// This mechanism is used for configuring such things as the location of the
/// scrollbar arrows through the theme, giving theme authors more control over the
/// look of applications without the need to write a theme engine in C.
/// 
/// Use `gtk_widget_class_install_style_property()` to install style properties for
/// a widget class, `gtk_widget_class_find_style_property()` or
/// `gtk_widget_class_list_style_properties()` to get information about existing
/// style properties and `gtk_widget_style_get_property()`, `gtk_widget_style_get()` or
/// `gtk_widget_style_get_valist()` to obtain the value of a style property.
/// 
/// # GtkWidget as GtkBuildable
/// 
/// The GtkWidget implementation of the GtkBuildable interface supports a
/// custom &lt;accelerator&gt; element, which has attributes named ”key”, ”modifiers”
/// and ”signal” and allows to specify accelerators.
/// 
/// An example of a UI definition fragment specifying an accelerator:
/// ```
/// <object class="GtkButton">
///   <accelerator key="q" modifiers="GDK_CONTROL_MASK" signal="clicked"/>
/// </object>
/// ```
/// 
/// In addition to accelerators, GtkWidget also support a custom &lt;accessible&gt;
/// element, which supports actions and relations. Properties on the accessible
/// implementation of an object can be set by accessing the internal child
/// “accessible” of a `GtkWidget`.
/// 
/// An example of a UI definition fragment specifying an accessible:
/// ```
/// <object class="GtkLabel" id="label1"/>
///   <property name="label">I am a Label for a Button</property>
/// </object>
/// <object class="GtkButton" id="button1">
///   <accessibility>
///     <action action_name="click" translatable="yes">Click the button.</action>
///     <relation target="label1" type="labelled-by"/>
///   </accessibility>
///   <child internal-child="accessible">
///     <object class="AtkObject" id="a11y-button1">
///       <property name="accessible-name">Clickable Button</property>
///     </object>
///   </child>
/// </object>
/// ```
/// 
/// Finally, GtkWidget allows style information such as style classes to
/// be associated with widgets, using the custom &lt;style&gt; element:
/// ```
/// <object class="GtkButton" id="button1">
///   <style>
///     <class name="my-special-button-class"/>
///     <class name="dark-button"/>
///   </style>
/// </object>
/// ```
/// 
/// # Building composite widgets from template XML ## <a name="composite-templates"></a>
/// 
/// GtkWidget exposes some facilities to automate the procedure
/// of creating composite widgets using `GtkBuilder` interface description
/// language.
/// 
/// To create composite widgets with `GtkBuilder` XML, one must associate
/// the interface description with the widget class at class initialization
/// time using `gtk_widget_class_set_template()`.
/// 
/// The interface description semantics expected in composite template descriptions
/// is slightly different from regular `GtkBuilder` XML.
/// 
/// Unlike regular interface descriptions, `gtk_widget_class_set_template()` will
/// expect a &lt;template&gt; tag as a direct child of the toplevel &lt;interface&gt;
/// tag. The &lt;template&gt; tag must specify the “class” attribute which must be
/// the type name of the widget. Optionally, the “parent” attribute may be
/// specified to specify the direct parent type of the widget type, this is
/// ignored by the GtkBuilder but required for Glade to introspect what kind
/// of properties and internal children exist for a given type when the actual
/// type does not exist.
/// 
/// The XML which is contained inside the &lt;template&gt; tag behaves as if it were
/// added to the &lt;object&gt; tag defining `widget` itself. You may set properties
/// on `widget` by inserting &lt;property&gt; tags into the &lt;template&gt; tag, and also
/// add &lt;child&gt; tags to add children and extend `widget` in the normal way you
/// would with &lt;object&gt; tags.
/// 
/// Additionally, &lt;object&gt; tags can also be added before and after the initial
/// &lt;template&gt; tag in the normal way, allowing one to define auxiliary objects
/// which might be referenced by other widgets declared as children of the
/// &lt;template&gt; tag.
/// 
/// An example of a GtkBuilder Template Definition:
/// ```
/// <interface>
///   <template class="FooWidget" parent="GtkBox">
///     <property name="orientation">GTK_ORIENTATION_HORIZONTAL</property>
///     <property name="spacing">4</property>
///     <child>
///       <object class="GtkButton" id="hello_button">
///         <property name="label">Hello World</property>
///         <signal name="clicked" handler="hello_button_clicked" object="FooWidget" swapped="yes"/>
///       </object>
///     </child>
///     <child>
///       <object class="GtkButton" id="goodbye_button">
///         <property name="label">Goodbye World</property>
///       </object>
///     </child>
///   </template>
/// </interface>
/// ```
/// 
/// Typically, you'll place the template fragment into a file that is
/// bundled with your project, using `GResource`. In order to load the
/// template, you need to call `gtk_widget_class_set_template_from_resource()`
/// from the class initialization of your `GtkWidget` type:
/// 
/// (C Language Example):
/// ```C
/// static void
/// foo_widget_class_init (FooWidgetClass *klass)
/// {
///   // ...
/// 
///   gtk_widget_class_set_template_from_resource (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),
///                                                "/com/example/ui/foowidget.ui");
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// You will also need to call `gtk_widget_init_template()` from the instance
/// initialization function:
/// 
/// (C Language Example):
/// ```C
/// static void
/// foo_widget_init (FooWidget *self)
/// {
///   // ...
///   gtk_widget_init_template (GTK_WIDGET (self));
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// You can access widgets defined in the template using the
/// `gtk_widget_get_template_child()` function, but you will typically declare
/// a pointer in the instance private data structure of your type using the same
/// name as the widget in the template definition, and call
/// `gtk_widget_class_bind_template_child_private()` with that name, e.g.
/// 
/// (C Language Example):
/// ```C
/// typedef struct {
///   GtkWidget *hello_button;
///   GtkWidget *goodbye_button;
/// } FooWidgetPrivate;
/// 
/// G_DEFINE_TYPE_WITH_PRIVATE (FooWidget, foo_widget, GTK_TYPE_BOX)
/// 
/// static void
/// foo_widget_class_init (FooWidgetClass *klass)

///                                                 FooWidget, goodbye_button);
/// }
/// 
/// static void
/// foo_widget_init (FooWidget *widget)
/// {
/// 
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// You can also use `gtk_widget_class_bind_template_callback()` to connect a signal
/// callback defined in the template with a function visible in the scope of the
/// class, e.g.
/// 
/// (C Language Example):
/// ```C
/// // the signal handler has the instance and user data swapped
/// // because of the swapped="yes" attribute in the template XML
/// static void
/// hello_button_clicked (FooWidget *self,
///                       GtkButton *button)

// MARK: - TreeModel Interface

/// The `GtkTreeModel` interface defines a generic tree interface for
/// use by the `GtkTreeView` widget. It is an abstract interface, and
/// is designed to be usable with any appropriate data structure. The
/// programmer just has to implement this interface on their own data
/// type for it to be viewable by a `GtkTreeView` widget.
/// 
/// The model is represented as a hierarchical tree of strongly-typed,
/// columned data. In other words, the model can be seen as a tree where
/// every node has different values depending on which column is being
/// queried. The type of data found in a column is determined by using
/// the GType system (ie. `G_TYPE_INT`, `GTK_TYPE_BUTTON`, `G_TYPE_POINTER`,
/// etc). The types are homogeneous per column across all nodes. It is
/// important to note that this interface only provides a way of examining
/// a model and observing changes. The implementation of each individual
/// model decides how and if changes are made.
/// 
/// In order to make life simpler for programmers who do not need to
/// write their own specialized model, two generic models are provided
/// — the `GtkTreeStore` and the `GtkListStore`. To use these, the
/// developer simply pushes data into these models as necessary. These
/// models provide the data structure as well as all appropriate tree
/// interfaces. As a result, implementing drag and drop, sorting, and
/// storing data is trivial. For the vast majority of trees and lists,
/// these two models are sufficient.
/// 
/// Models are accessed on a node/column level of granularity. One can
/// query for the value of a model at a certain node and a certain
/// column on that node. There are two structures used to reference a
/// particular node in a model. They are the `GtkTreePath-struct` and
/// the `GtkTreeIter-struct` (“iter” is short for iterator). Most of the
/// interface consists of operations on a `GtkTreeIter-struct`.
/// 
/// A path is essentially a potential node. It is a location on a model
/// that may or may not actually correspond to a node on a specific
/// model. The `GtkTreePath-struct` can be converted into either an
/// array of unsigned integers or a string. The string form is a list
/// of numbers separated by a colon. Each number refers to the offset
/// at that level. Thus, the path `0` refers to the root
/// node and the path `2:4` refers to the fifth child of
/// the third node.
/// 
/// By contrast, a `GtkTreeIter-struct` is a reference to a specific node on
/// a specific model. It is a generic struct with an integer and three
/// generic pointers. These are filled in by the model in a model-specific
/// way. One can convert a path to an iterator by calling
/// `gtk_tree_model_get_iter()`. These iterators are the primary way
/// of accessing a model and are similar to the iterators used by
/// `GtkTextBuffer`. They are generally statically allocated on the
/// stack and only used for a short time. The model interface defines
/// a set of operations using them for navigating the model.
/// 
/// It is expected that models fill in the iterator with private data.
/// For example, the `GtkListStore` model, which is internally a simple
/// linked list, stores a list node in one of the pointers. The
/// `GtkTreeModelSort` stores an array and an offset in two of the
/// pointers. Additionally, there is an integer field. This field is
/// generally filled with a unique stamp per model. This stamp is for
/// catching errors resulting from using invalid iterators with a model.
/// 
/// The lifecycle of an iterator can be a little confusing at first.
/// Iterators are expected to always be valid for as long as the model
/// is unchanged (and doesn’t emit a signal). The model is considered
/// to own all outstanding iterators and nothing needs to be done to
/// free them from the user’s point of view. Additionally, some models
/// guarantee that an iterator is valid for as long as the node it refers
/// to is valid (most notably the `GtkTreeStore` and `GtkListStore`).
/// Although generally uninteresting, as one always has to allow for
/// the case where iterators do not persist beyond a signal, some very
/// important performance enhancements were made in the sort model.
/// As a result, the `GTK_TREE_MODEL_ITERS_PERSIST` flag was added to
/// indicate this behavior.
/// 
/// To help show some common operation of a model, some examples are
/// provided. The first example shows three ways of getting the iter at
/// the location `3:2:5`. While the first method shown is
/// easier, the second is much more common, as you often get paths from
/// callbacks.
/// 
/// ## Acquiring a `GtkTreeIter-struct`
/// 
/// (C Language Example):

/// parent_iter = iter;

/// The `GtkTreeModel` interface contains two methods for reference
/// counting: `gtk_tree_model_ref_node()` and `gtk_tree_model_unref_node()`.
/// These two methods are optional to implement. The reference counting
/// is meant as a way for views to let models know when nodes are being
/// displayed. `GtkTreeView` will take a reference on a node when it is
/// visible, which means the node is either in the toplevel or expanded.
/// Being displayed does not mean that the node is currently directly
/// visible to the user in the viewport. Based on this reference counting
/// scheme a caching model, for example, can decide whether or not to cache
/// a node based on the reference count. A file-system based model would
/// not want to keep the entire file hierarchy in memory, but just the
/// folders that are currently expanded in every current view.
/// 
/// When working with reference counting, the following rules must be taken
/// into account:
/// 
/// - Never take a reference on a node without owning a reference on its parent.
///   This means that all parent nodes of a referenced node must be referenced
///   as well.
/// 
/// - Outstanding references on a deleted node are not released. This is not
///   possible because the node has already been deleted by the time the
///   row-deleted signal is received.
/// 
/// - Models are not obligated to emit a signal on rows of which none of its
///   siblings are referenced. To phrase this differently, signals are only
///   required for levels in which nodes are referenced. For the root level
///   however, signals must be emitted at all times (however the root level

/// — the `GtkTreeStore` and the `GtkListStore`. To use these, the
/// developer simply pushes data into these models as necessary. These
/// models provide the data structure as well as all appropriate tree
/// interfaces. As a result, implementing drag and drop, sorting, and
/// storing data is trivial. For the vast majority of trees and lists,
/// these two models are sufficient.
/// 
/// Models are accessed on a node/column level of granularity. One can
/// query for the value of a model at a certain node and a certain
/// column on that node. There are two structures used to reference a
/// particular node in a model. They are the `GtkTreePath-struct` and
/// the `GtkTreeIter-struct` (“iter” is short for iterator). Most of the
/// interface consists of operations on a `GtkTreeIter-struct`.
/// 
/// A path is essentially a potential node. It is a location on a model
/// that may or may not actually correspond to a node on a specific
/// model. The `GtkTreePath-struct` can be converted into either an
/// array of unsigned integers or a string. The string form is a list
/// of numbers separated by a colon. Each number refers to the offset
/// at that level. Thus, the path `0` refers to the root
/// node and the path `2:4` refers to the fifth child of
/// the third node.
/// 
/// By contrast, a `GtkTreeIter-struct` is a reference to a specific node on
/// a specific model. It is a generic struct with an integer and three
/// generic pointers. These are filled in by the model in a model-specific
/// way. One can convert a path to an iterator by calling
/// `gtk_tree_model_get_iter()`. These iterators are the primary way
/// of accessing a model and are similar to the iterators used by
/// `GtkTextBuffer`. They are generally statically allocated on the
/// stack and only used for a short time. The model interface defines
/// a set of operations using them for navigating the model.
/// 
/// It is expected that models fill in the iterator with private data.
/// For example, the `GtkListStore` model, which is internally a simple
/// linked list, stores a list node in one of the pointers. The
/// `GtkTreeModelSort` stores an array and an offset in two of the
/// pointers. Additionally, there is an integer field. This field is
/// generally filled with a unique stamp per model. This stamp is for
/// catching errors resulting from using invalid iterators with a model.
/// 
/// The lifecycle of an iterator can be a little confusing at first.
/// Iterators are expected to always be valid for as long as the model
/// is unchanged (and doesn’t emit a signal). The model is considered
/// to own all outstanding iterators and nothing needs to be done to
/// free them from the user’s point of view. Additionally, some models
/// guarantee that an iterator is valid for as long as the node it refers
/// to is valid (most notably the `GtkTreeStore` and `GtkListStore`).
/// Although generally uninteresting, as one always has to allow for
/// the case where iterators do not persist beyond a signal, some very
/// important performance enhancements were made in the sort model.
/// As a result, the `GTK_TREE_MODEL_ITERS_PERSIST` flag was added to
/// indicate this behavior.
/// 
/// To help show some common operation of a model, some examples are
/// provided. The first example shows three ways of getting the iter at
/// the location `3:2:5`. While the first method shown is
/// easier, the second is much more common, as you often get paths from
/// callbacks.
/// 
/// ## Acquiring a `GtkTreeIter-struct`
/// 
/// (C Language Example):
/// ```C
/// // Three ways of getting the iter pointing to the location
/// GtkTreePath *path;
/// GtkTreeIter iter;
/// GtkTreeIter parent_iter;
/// 
/// // get the iterator from a string
/// gtk_tree_model_get_iter_from_string (model,
///                                      &iter,
///                                      "3:2:5");
/// 
/// // get the iterator from a path
/// path = gtk_tree_path_new_from_string ("3:2:5");
/// gtk_tree_model_get_iter (model, &iter, path);
/// gtk_tree_path_free (path);
/// 
/// // walk the tree to find the iterator
/// gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (model, &iter,
///                                NULL, 3);
/// parent_iter = iter;
/// gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (model, &iter,
///                                &parent_iter, 2);
/// parent_iter = iter;
/// gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (model, &iter,
///                                &parent_iter, 5);
/// ```
/// 
/// This second example shows a quick way of iterating through a list
/// and getting a string and an integer from each row. The
/// `populate_model()` function used below is not
/// shown, as it is specific to the `GtkListStore`. For information on
/// how to write such a function, see the `GtkListStore` documentation.
/// 
/// ## Reading data from a `GtkTreeModel`
/// 
/// (C Language Example):
/// ```C
/// enum
/// {
///   STRING_COLUMN,
///   INT_COLUMN,
///   N_COLUMNS
/// };
/// 
/// ...
/// 
/// GtkTreeModel *list_store;
/// GtkTreeIter iter;
/// gboolean valid;
/// gint row_count = 0;
/// 
/// // make a new list_store
/// list_store = gtk_list_store_new (N_COLUMNS,

///                                        &iter);
/// while (valid)
///  {
///    gchar *str_data;
///    gint   int_data;
/// 
///    // Make sure you terminate calls to gtk_tree_model_get() with a “-1” value
///    gtk_tree_model_get (list_store, &iter,
///                        STRING_COLUMN, &str_data,
///                        INT_COLUMN, &int_data,
///                        -1);
/// 
///    // Do something with the data
///    g_print ("Row %d: (%s,%d)\n",
///             row_count, str_data, int_data);
///    g_free (str_data);
/// 
///    valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (list_store,
///                                      &iter);
///    row_count++;
///  }
/// ```
/// 
/// The `GtkTreeModel` interface contains two methods for reference
/// counting: `gtk_tree_model_ref_node()` and `gtk_tree_model_unref_node()`.
/// These two methods are optional to implement. The reference counting
/// is meant as a way for views to let models know when nodes are being
/// displayed. `GtkTreeView` will take a reference on a node when it is
/// visible, which means the node is either in the toplevel or expanded.
/// Being displayed does not mean that the node is currently directly
/// visible to the user in the viewport. Based on this reference counting
/// scheme a caching model, for example, can decide whether or not to cache
/// a node based on the reference count. A file-system based model would
/// not want to keep the entire file hierarchy in memory, but just the
/// folders that are currently expanded in every current view.
/// 
/// When working with reference counting, the following rules must be taken
/// into account:
/// 
/// - Never take a reference on a node without owning a reference on its parent.
///   This means that all parent nodes of a referenced node must be referenced
///   as well.
/// 
/// - Outstanding references on a deleted node are not released. This is not
///   possible because the node has already been deleted by the time the
///   row-deleted signal is received.
/// 
/// - Models are not obligated to emit a signal on rows of which none of its
///   siblings are referenced. To phrase this differently, signals are only
///   required for levels in which nodes are referenced. For the root level
///   however, signals must be emitted at all times (however the root level
///   is always referenced when any view is attached).
///
/// The `TreeModel` type acts as an owner of an underlying `GtkTreeModel` instance.
/// It provides the methods that can operate on this data type through `TreeModelProtocol` conformance.
/// Use `TreeModel` as a strong reference or owner of a `GtkTreeModel` instance.

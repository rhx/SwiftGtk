# SwiftGtk

A Swift wrapper around gtk-3.x and gtk-4.x that is largely auto-generated from gobject-introspection.
This project tries to make gtk more "swifty" than using the plain C language interface.

For up to date (auto-generated) reference documentation, see [https://rhx.github.io/SwiftGtk/](https://rhx.github.io/SwiftGtk/).


[SwiftGtk](git@github.com:rhx/SwiftGtk.git) allows you to use the Gtk user interface toolkit
directly from Swift without having to resort to using the low-level C interface.
Gtk has been in development for many years and is used by numerous open source
programs and libraries.
Gtk is a cross-platform toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that is written in C.
It can be used to create desktop applications for Linux, Windows, and macOS.
Gtk provides a comprehensive set of widgets and tools for creating GUIs, including buttons,
text boxes, tables, menus, and more. 

SwiftGtk provides a more natural and intuitive way to use Gtk in Swift than using the plain C
language interface.  The Swift interface is largely auto-generated from gobject-introspection,
which makes it more straightforward to keep up with changes in they underlying Gtk libraries.

    /// disconnected, or immediately if the cancellable is already

    /// @callback is called at most once, either directly at the
    /// time of the connect if @cancellable is already cancelled,
    /// or when @cancellable is cancelled in some thread.

    /// Since GLib 2.40, the lock protecting @cancellable is not held when
    /// @callback is invoked.  This lifts a restriction in place for
    /// earlier GLib versions which now makes it easier to write cleanup
    /// code that unconditionally invokes e.g. g_cancellable_cancel().

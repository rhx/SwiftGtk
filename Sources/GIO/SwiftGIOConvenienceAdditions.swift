/// Convenience additions for Cancellables
public extension CancellableProtocol {
    /// Convenience method to connect to the ``cancelledSignal``.
    ///
    /// This method also handles the race condition that may happen
    /// if the cancellable is cancelled right before connecting.
    ///
    /// The `dataDestroyFunc` will be called when the handler is
    /// disconnected, or immediately if the cancellable is already
    /// cancelled.
    ///
    /// `callback` is called at most once, either directly at the
    /// time of the connect if the ``Cancellable`` is already cancelled,
    /// or when the ``Cancellable`` is cancelled in some thread.
    ///
    /// See ``isCancelled`` for details on how to use this.
    ///
    /// Since GLib 2.40, the lock protecting the ``Cancellable`` is not held when
    /// `callback` is invoked.  This lifts a restriction in place for
    /// earlier GLib versions, which now makes it easier to write cleanup
    /// code that unconditionally invokes e.g. ``cancel()``.
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - data: Pointer to the data to pass to the callback
    ///   - dataDestroyFunc: Function to call to free the data.
    ///   - callback: Callback to call when the cancellable is cancelled.
    /// - Returns: The handler ID (always greater than 0).

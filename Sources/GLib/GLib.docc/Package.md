# SwiftGLib

A Swift wrapper around glib-2.x that is largely auto-generated from gobject-introspection.
For up to date (auto-generated) reference documentation, see
[https://rhx.github.io/SwiftGLib/](https://rhx.github.io/SwiftGLib/).

## Overview

[SwiftGLib](https://github.com/rhx/SwiftGLib/) allows you to use the low-level GLib library
directly from Swift without having to resort to using the low-level C interface.
GLib has been in development for many years and is used by numerous open source
programs and libraries including [Gtk](https://rhx.github.io/SwiftGtk/).
GLib is particularly useful for organising low-level data by providing abstractions
for data structures, containers, and collections that can directly be used by C code
as well as Swift.
